		<h3>How to shop for a prom dress the RIGHT way!</h3>

        <!-- Paragraph about shopping with someone -->
        <p>When shopping for your prom dress it's best to take someone along for a second opinion.  You Mom and/or sister is a good choice since they will tell you how they really feel about a dress.  If you take a friend (or friends), be sensitive to the other person's budget.  Only go to places you both find affordable. </p>
        
        <!-- Paragraph about affordability -->
        <p>And speaking for affordable...  The average prom dress now costs $500!!  That's a lot of money.  Experts I talked to (Padua Seniors) suggested sticking to dresses under $300 since you have to factor in the cost of alterations, shoes (high & low heels!) and accessories.  Which add up fast!</p>
        
        <!-- Paragraph about keeping dresses unique -->
		<p>When you find a dress, it is customary to post a picture of the dress to the designated Facebook page so no two girls have the same dress.  This is important since it gives you "dibs" on that dress.  I don't know what happens when two girls pick the same dress, but it sounds like a disaster!  :) </p>
		
        <!-- A list of Padua rules -->
        <p class="greenText">Also when shopping, keep in mind some of these Padua Prom Dress Rules:</p>

            <li>No high slits</li>
            <li>No cutouts - bare sides or belly</li>
        </ul>
        
        <!-- Paragraph of things to keep in mind -->
        <p>Some things to think about before you hit the stores: Do some research on popular dress styles for the season; Think about what styles look best on you; Only purchase from a trustworthy retailer; Determine your budget <b>before</b> you go shopping.</p> 
        
        <p id= "redText">Take your time and start shopping early!  But above all, have fun!</p>
